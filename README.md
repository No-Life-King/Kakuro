# Kakuro
This project was completed by Phil Smith and Bobby Palmer during the fall 2017 semester for <i>CSC 331 - Object Oriented Programming and Design</i> at UNCW. The project requirements were fairly simple. Our professor uploaded a picture of the "Conceptis Kakuro" puzzle game from a news paper and told us to write a program that only allows a user to enter valid values into each of its puzzle squares. Apart from that, it simply had to be able to read a puzzle of arbitrary size from a file, save an incomplete puzzle back to a file, clear the puzzle board, and implement one extra feature of our own choosing.
